### Introduction

The **OSM Procedural Generator** is a tool that allows for the automatic generation of OSM entities such as nodes, ways, and relations. These entities are created procedurally to ensure the consistency and realism of the generated maps.

### Features

- Procedural generation of OSM nodes, ways, and relations.
- Validation of the consistency of generated entities.
- Extensibility to add more complex structures.
- Integration of DevOps practices for increased development rigor.
- Unit and integration tests to ensure code reliability.

### Installation

To install and set up the project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/osm-procedural-generator.git
    cd osm-procedural-generator
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```sh
    python3 -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate   # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

To generate procedural OSM files, run the main script:

```sh
python main.py
```

This script will generate an OSM XML file containing procedurally generated nodes and ways.
